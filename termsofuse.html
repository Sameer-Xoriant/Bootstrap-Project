                            In order to pass on the cashback benefits to the maximum number of customers, we are limiting cashback to 2 transactions per person (Buyer or Seller) per month.
                            Cashback will be based on final agreed price of the product between buyer and seller. Buyers will have cashback eligibility for full online payment orders only, for partial payment orders, buyer will receive no net cashback<br><br>
                            Buyers and Sellers would be charged convenience fee based on weight classification of the concerned product. <br>
                            If applicable the Net Cashback Amount will be credited in the PayTM wallet of the Buyer/Seller
